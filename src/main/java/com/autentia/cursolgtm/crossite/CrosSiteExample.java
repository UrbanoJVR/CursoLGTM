        There are a number of reasons why it may make sense to hide or remove an alert, and a number of ways to go about it.
        The result is incorrect

        If this result is a false positive, you can tell us about it so that we can improve the query, and hence the results for everyone. See What if I see a false positive? for more details.
        I'm not interested in this alert

        If you want to remove only this alert (and not other similar alerts), you can add the comment lgtm [java/xss] to the end of line 196. See Alert suppression for more details.
        Cross-site scripting vulnerability due to user-provided value.
                LOG.warn("A session for clientID '" + clientID + "' has already been established");
        return null;

}
